  /**
   * When we extend the `Component` class a few things are happening under the hood.
   *
   * 1. The super constructor overwrites all player properties with fresh getters/setters. Not all
   * properties contain setters (readonly), so it's best to refer to the documentation.
   * 2. The component binds itself to the player context so that player properties are updated as
   * they change.
   * 3. The component will dispatch any updates to the player if a writable player prop is changed.
   * 4. When the component is destroyed, it will automatically unbind itself from the player.
   *
   * IMPORTANT: The `ElementRef` is required as the `Component` class uses it to dispatch
   * custom events to the player. Angular automatically injects this value.
   *
   * @see https://vimejs.com/components/core/player/api
