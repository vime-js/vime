| `autoplay`                        | Whether playback should automatically begin playing once the media is ready to do so. This will only work if the browsers `autoplay` policies have been satisfied. It'll generally work if the player is muted, or the user frequently interacts with your site. You can check if it's possible to autoplay via the `canAutoplay()` or `canMutedAutoplay()` methods. Depending on the provider, changing this prop may cause the player to completely reset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `boolean`                                                                                                                               | `false`     |

| `playbackQuality`                 | Indicates the quality of the media. The value will differ between audio and video. For audio this might be some combination of the encoding format (AAC, MP3), bitrate in kilobits per second (kbps) and sample rate in kilohertz (kHZ). For video this will be the number of vertical pixels it supports. For example, if the video has a resolution of `1920x1080` then the quality will return `1080p`. Defaults to `undefined` which you can interpret as the quality is unknown. The value can also be `Auto` for adaptive bit streams (ABR), where the provider can automatically manage the playback quality. The quality can only be set to a quality found in the `playbackQualities` prop. Some providers may not allow changing the quality, you can check if it's possible via `canSetPlaybackQuality()`. | `string ∣ undefined`                                                                                                                    | `undefined` |
| `playbackRate`                    | A `double` indicating the rate at which media is being played back. If the value is `<1` then playback is slowed down; if `>1` then playback is sped up. Defaults to `1`. The playback rate can only be set to a rate found in the `playbackRates` prop.

| `enterFullscreen`           | Requests to enter fullscreen mode, returning a `Promise` that will resolve if the request is made, or reject with a reason for failure. This method will first attempt to use the browsers native fullscreen API, and then fallback to requesting the provider to do it (if available). Do not rely on a resolved promise to determine if the player is in fullscreen or not. The only way to be certain is by listening to the `vmFullscreenChange` event. Some common reasons for failure are: the fullscreen API is not available, the request is made when `viewType` is audio, or the user has not interacted with the page yet. | `enterFullscreen(options?: FullscreenOptions ∣ undefined) => Promise<void>`                       |
| `enterPiP`                  | Request to enter picture-in-picture (PiP) mode, returning a `Promise` that will resolve if the request is made, or reject with a reason for failure. Do not rely on a resolved promise to determine if the player is in PiP mode or not. The only way to be certain is by listening to the `vmPiPChange` event. Some common reasons for failure are the same as the reasons for `enterFullscreen()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `enterPiP() => Promise<void ∣ undefined>`                                                         |
