## Code of Conduct

Vime has adopted the [Contributor's Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
and can be found [here](https://github.com/vime-js/vime/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Get Involved

There are many ways to contribute to Vime, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's
a few ideas to get started:

- Start using Vime. Go through the [Getting Started](../getting-started/installation) guides. Does
  everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for ways to improve. Let us know by
  [opening an issue](https://github.com/vime-js/vime/issues).
- Look through the [issues](https://github.com/vime-js/vime/issues). If you find an issue
  you would like to fix, [open a pull request](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
- Help us in making the docs better. File an issue if you find anything that is confusing or can be
  improved.
- Take a look at the [features requested](https://github.com/vime-js/vime/labels/enhancement) by
  others in the community and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.
- Is there a new provider you'd like us to support? See our
  [Providers Guide](https://github.com/vime-js/vime/blob/master/.github/PROVIDERS.md).
- Want to add some shiny new UI features? See our
  [UI Guide](https://github.com/vime-js/vime/blob/master/.github/UI.md).

## Development Process

All of the source code for Vime lives in our [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/vime-js/vime).
It's important to note that everything is automated in Vime from building packages, docs, linting,
testing and releasing. All changes are checked and processed by our continuous integration
system (GitHub Actions).

## Writing Code

The best way to get started writing code is by going through the
[Contributing Guide](https://github.com/vime-js/vime/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub. It contains
instructions for everything you need to go from zero to PR!
