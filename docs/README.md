# @vime/docs

Vime is a customizable, extensible, accessible and framework agnostic media player. This package 
contains the source code for the Vime documentation site hosted at https://vimejs.com. The website 
is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

```bash
$: yarn install

$: yarn start
```

The `start` command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes
are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## API Documentation

It's important to note that **[`components`](./docs/components) is autogenerated** by
`@vime/core`. If you'd like to update those docs then make any changes inside
[`packages/core/src/components`](../packages/core/src/components) and then run the following to update:

```bash
$: cd ..

$: yarn install

$: yarn core build
```
