# @vime/stencil-example

This example was bootstrapped using the [`stencil`](https://stenciljs.com/docs/getting-started) NPM 
starter, and demonstrates how to setup Vime with Stencil via the `@vime/core` package. The main files 
to look at are:

- [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts): Shows how to simply import the player library.
- [`src/components/app-home/app-home.tsx`](./src/components/app-home/app-home.tsx): Shows how to 
  setup the player.
- [`src/components/app-home/app-home.css`](./src/components/app-home/app-home.css): Shows how to 
  load the default player themes.
- [`src/components/tap-sides-to-seek`](./src/components/tap-sides-to-seek): Shows how to build a 
  custom component.
