# @vime/rollup-example

This example simply demonstrates how to bundle Vime (`@vime/core`) using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org). The 
example is here for you to play with, but all you need to do is `import` whatever components and 
there dependencies you need into your project, and define them in the custom elements registry. There 
are no additional steps required (see [`src/index.js`](./src/index.js)).

## Usage

```bash
$: git clone https://github.com/vime-js/vime --depth=1

$: cd vime/examples/rollup

$: npm install

$: npm run serve
```
