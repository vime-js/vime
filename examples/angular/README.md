# @vime/angular-example

This example was bootstrapped with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io), and demonstrates how to
setup Vime with Angular via the `@vime/angular` package. See [`src/styles.css`](./src/styles.css)
and the [`app`](./src/app) module directory. In addition, if you're interested in building custom
components see the [`src/app/tap-sides-to-seek`](./src/app/tap-sides-to-seek) directory.

## Usage

```bash
$: git clone https://github.com/vime-js/vime --depth=1

```
