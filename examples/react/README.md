# @vime/react-example

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
and demonstrates how to setup Vime with React via the `@vime/react` package. The main
file to look at is [`App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx), and if you're interested in building custom
components see [`TapSidesToSeek.tsx`](./src/TapSidesToSeek.tsx).

## Usage

```bash
$: git clone https://github.com/vime-js/vime --depth=1

$: cd vime/examples/react

$: npm install

$: npm run serve
```
