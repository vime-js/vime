00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.500
You're a jerk, Thom.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Look Celia, we have to follow our passions;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500
...you have your robotics, and I
just want to be awesome in space.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.000
Why don't you just admit that
you're freaked out by my robot hand?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm not freaked out by- it's...

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
...alright! Fine!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm freaked out! I have nightmares
that I'm being chased...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
...by these giant robotic claws of death...

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.000
"Fourty years later"
Whatever, Thom. We're done.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.500
Robot's memory synced and locked!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This is pretty freaky.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Shouldn't you be down there?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I heard you guys talking last night.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It's not my fault, you know.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Are you ready?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Of course you're ready, you're a rockstar.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
How's it looking, Barley?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We should have about ten minutes...

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.000
Well that's perfect.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.500
We're on in one! All systems go!
Yeah you, go!

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Go! Move your asses! Go go go!

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I love it! Come on, go!

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
That's nice.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.700
Nothing to worry about.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Thom.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
There she is.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.500
Now.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
You love her.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.500
She is your passion!

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Be tender to her.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.500
Be honest! Eh- be tender.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Remind her what love is.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
...and, action!

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.000
Memory overwrite in progress!

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You're a jerk, Thom!

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.000
Ohp- Sorry! Sorry.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Look Celia.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We have to follow our passions.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
You have your robotics...

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
...and I just want to be awesome in space.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Okay, they're coming. Two minutes left!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Speed it up, Thom!

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Vivacissimo!

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Why don't you just admit that you're
freaked out by my robot hand?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Listen Celia, I was young...

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.000
...and a dick.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But that's no reason to
destroy the world.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Why does he do this?

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.500
We already tried that one!

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.500
Abort!

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Cut!

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Whoaaa!

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Whoaaa!

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Nooooo!

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
You broke my heart.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I know.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
You forgot me on earth.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I know.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.000
I should just crush you.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I'm-

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I'm sorry.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Good ad-lib.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.500
Not my fault!

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
This time.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.500
Quiet on set!

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
We're out of time!

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Come on!

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
RAAAAAAAAH!

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Memory overwrite, 90%.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Captain! We have to abort!

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The world's changed, Celia...

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
...maybe we can too.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Memory overwrite complete!

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
You know.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
There's a lesson to be learned from this.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Could'a gone worse.
